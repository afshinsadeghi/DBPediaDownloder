# DBPediaDownloder

Do you like to have the whole DBpedia dataset downloaded into your system in one piece? This code does the work for you. It creates a single dbpedia.ttl of the last dbpedia.

## How it works:

This code downloads and extracts and merges all ttl files of the "current" version of DBpedia into one file
 with name dbpedia.ttl


## How to use it:

 1. Make > 300 GB of free disk space on your disk

 2. Install bzip2 on your system

 3. Install these python packages: "requests" "mechanize" "subprocess" ,"time"

 4. Run it and leave it to do the rest:   python dbpediaDown.py
